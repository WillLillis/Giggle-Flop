# Giggle Flop

A toy ISA designed and simulated from scratch.

## Memory System

- Configurable cache
    - Variable number of levels
    - Custom access latency and capacity per level
    - Cache line length configurable
- Write-through no-allocate scheme
- Direct mapped cache

## TODO

- 5 stage CPU pipeline -- Close to done!
- Branch predictor -- TBD
- GUI debugger -- In progress!
- Serialization/Deserialization of program/machine state -- Stretch goal
- Other ideas/ optimizations as we work through the project :)
